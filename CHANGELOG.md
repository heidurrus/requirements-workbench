# Changelog

## 2.9.3 (2026-09-28): Jira sign-in asks which account

- **Подключить Jira** now opens the Atlassian sign-in in a **private browser window**
  (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Chromium or Firefox). A normal window silently reused whatever
  Atlassian account the browser was already logged into, e.g. a work account, and
  Atlassian's sign-in gives apps no way to ask for an account choice. In a private window you
  log in with the account you want. **в обычном окне** is still there if you prefer.
- The Выгрузка screen warns when the connected account can't see the site the project is set
  to push to.

## 2.9.2 (2026-09-28): Jira without the Keychain

- Connecting Jira no longer involves the macOS Keychain, which kept asking for access. You
  sign in in the browser as before, and the app keeps the sign-in in a private file in its own
  data folder (readable only by your user account, like the Anthropic key). **Отключить**
  removes it.
- Old Keychain entries named "RequirementsWorkbench.atlassian" are no longer used. You can
  delete them in Keychain Access, or just leave them.

## 2.9.1 (2026-09-28): Output language, Jira sign-in fix

- **Язык результатов per project** (Settings → Проект): Как в источниках / Русский / English.
  The AI writes summaries, requirements, the FRD, stories and criteria, and the labels in Jira
  descriptions in that language, translating from Russian or English sources. Quotes stay in
  the original language, because they're evidence. Switching the language rebuilds the whole
  document, and the Document screen tells you when it's in the other language.
- Fixed: connecting Jira failed with "403 … Error 1010". Atlassian's Cloudflare blocked
  Python's default user agent; the app now identifies itself. Found and fixed during a live
  push to a sandbox project.
- The Выгрузка screen shows which Atlassian sites the connection can access, so signing in
  with the wrong account (e.g. a work login remembered by the browser) is obvious.

## 2.9.0 (2026-09-28): Increment 4b, Jira export

- **A new Выгрузка screen (step 6).** It sends the ticked backlog to Jira Cloud through the
  Atlassian Remote MCP server.
  - **Подключить Jira** opens the Atlassian sign-in in your browser. The app registers
    itself; there are no keys to copy.
  - Sign-in tokens are kept in the macOS Keychain / Windows Credential Manager and refreshed
    automatically. **Отключить** removes them.
- **Choose the site and project** per workbench project. Issue types are mapped by what they
  are (epic level, sub-task flag), so localised types such as Эпик / История / Задача /
  Подзадача work. You can change the mapping.
- **A dry-run preview** with Создать · Обновить · Без изменений · Пропустить. It only reads
  Jira; nothing changes there until you press **Выгрузить N задач** and confirm the target
  project by name.
- **The push** creates epics first, then stories inside their epics, then sub-tasks under
  their stories. Each description carries the story, the acceptance criteria, the FRD reference
  (version · section · FR-n) and a verbatim source quote with date and time.
- **Safe to repeat:**
  - Every issue gets a `rw-…` label, so a retry after a failure finds issues already created
    instead of duplicating them.
  - Pushing again only updates what changed.
  - Issues edited in Jira since the last push are flagged and need an explicit tick to
    overwrite.
  - Failed rows are listed with the reason and can be retried.
- Only the fields the workbench owns are written: summary, description, labels, parent.

## 2.8.0 (2026-09-28): Increment 4a, decomposition

- **A new Декомпозиция screen (step 5).** **Собрать бэклог** turns the latest FRD into:
  - epics, each with the business goal it serves
  - user stories: "Как <роль>, я хочу …, чтобы …"
  - acceptance criteria in Дано / Когда / Тогда form, including negative cases
  - optional technical sub-tasks

  Every story links to its FRD section and requirement (FRD 3.1 · FR-2). Every functional
  requirement is covered; any the AI misses get a story of their own.
- **Tickboxes decide what goes to Jira.** Unticking an epic unticks its stories. AI-generated
  sub-tasks and non-functional requirements start unticked. An NFR can be moved into a
  story's criteria with one click.
- **Проверить по INVEST.** Each story is checked (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable,
  Estimable, Small, Testable), and problems come with a suggested fix you can apply.
- **Edit everything:** titles, story text, goals and criteria (add or remove), plus adding,
  reordering and deleting (with undo) epics, stories and sub-tasks. Edited items are pinned,
  so **Пересобрать** never overwrites them.
- When the document gets a newer version, the backlog tells you and offers to rebuild.
- Two new editable skills: **Декомпозиция на истории** and **Проверка INVEST**.
- The Document screen has a **К декомпозиции** link.

## 2.7.2 (2026-09-28): Action items are no longer requirements

- Extraction now tells **requirements** (what the system must do) apart from **action items**
  ("отправлю письмо", "Иван пришлёт выгрузку", "созвонимся в четверг") and other non-requirements
  (process, complaints without a stated need). Those are set aside instead of becoming
  functional requirements. The result shows how many action items were skipped.
- It still keeps real requirements that mention email when the *system* does it ("система
  отправляет клиенту письмо-подтверждение").
- Works with your own extraction skills too: the app's format contract now includes the two
  new labels. **Попробовать** in the skill editor lists what was skipped, so you can tune
  the rules.
- The built-in extraction skill has clearer rules and Russian examples of what is not a
  requirement.

## 2.7.1 (2026-09-28): Bulk review of atoms

- **Review hundreds of atoms at once.** Tick atoms (shift-click selects a range), or tick
  **Все (N)** to take everything matching the current filters. Then **Принять**,
  **Отклонить**, **На ревью** or **Сменить тип…** for all of them in one go, with one
  **Undo** for the whole batch. The bar shows how many of the selected atoms are in conflicts.
- **Source filter** in the atoms list, e.g. to accept everything from one email.
- Keyboard: Space ticks the current atom, ⌘A (Ctrl+A) ticks everything under the filters, Esc clears.
- Every change in a batch is still recorded in the audit log.

## 2.7.0 (2026-09-28): Increment 3b, skills

- **A new Скиллы screen.** Every AI step has an editable, shareable skill:
  - summary
  - requirement extraction
  - duplicates and conflicts
  - document assembly
  - quality check
  - fixes
  - the Word template

  Plus **house rules** (Общие инструкции) that apply to every step: terminology, glossary,
  tone ("always write 'заявитель', never 'клиент'").
- **Control the AI's output.** Write the instructions in your own words. The app adds a small,
  visible "format contract" (answer shape, verbatim quotes, never invent facts), so no edit can
  break the pipeline.
  - The document assembly skill decides the FRD's sections, their titles and order, and extra
    AI-written sections with their own instructions (e.g. a glossary).
  - The quality skill has editable vague-word lists and **your own checks** (e.g. "every
    functional requirement names a role").
- **Built-in skills** are read-only. **Сделать копию** gives you your own, with:
  - edit history and restore
  - **Попробовать**: run the unsaved draft on a real source or on the current project and
    see the result, without saving anything
  - delete with undo
- **Share skills.** Export a skill as a .zip and import a .zip or a single SKILL.md. The
  format is a folder with SKILL.md, like Anthropic's Agent Skills. Your skills are also plain
  folders you can open.
- **Global and per-project.** Choose the default skill for each step, and switch any project
  to a different one (e.g. GOST for one client, a lean FRD for another).
- **Word templates with your own layout.** Copy "Word — ГОСТ" or "Word — обычный", press
  **Открыть в Word** (or download it and upload it back), and design the document yourself:
  title page, logo, approval sheet, headers and footers, fixed text. Placeholders mark where
  content goes:
  - inline, anywhere including tables and headers: `{{title}}`, `{{version}}`, `{{date}}`
  - on their own line: `{{toc}}`, `{{body}}`, and single sections such as `{{section:functional}}`

  The Document screen's export lets you pick any Word skill.
- A new built-in **Сборка ТЗ по мотивам ГОСТ 34**: GOST-style section names and official
  wording.

## 2.6.0 (2026-09-28): Increment 3a, the FRD document

- **Build the FRD from accepted atoms.** A new **Документ** screen (step 4) turns the accepted
  requirements into a structured document:
  - sections: purpose, context and assumptions, functional requirements grouped into
    sub-sections, non-functional requirements, out of scope, open questions
  - each requirement worded formally, in the language of your sources
- **Stable IDs and sources.** Every requirement keeps its ID (FR-3, NFR-1, Q-2) across
  rebuilds, and IDs are never reused. It links to the exact places in your sources it came from.
- **Versions.** Every build is a new version. You can view older versions and compare any
  version with the previous one (added / changed / removed).
- **Stale sections and rebuild.** Changing, rejecting or adding an atom marks the affected
  sections as out of date. **Rebuild** rewrites only what changed and keeps everything else word
  for word. **Rebuild everything** is there when you want a fresh pass.
- **Quality check.** Requirements are checked for vague words ("быстро", "удобно"), missing
  metrics, ambiguity, several requirements in one, and untestable wording. **Починить**
  proposes a rewrite. You can edit it and apply it to the atom, or dismiss the finding.
- **Your own text.** Add pinned paragraphs to any section. They're kept verbatim through
  every rebuild.
- **Export to Word.** A standard template or a **GOST** one (title page, Times New Roman 14,
  1.5 spacing, GOST margins, page numbers), both with a table of contents. Each requirement's
  sources become footnotes: date, time, speaker and the exact quote.
- **Unresolved conflicts don't block the build.** The affected requirements are marked in
  the document.
- Fixed: saving files (transcript .txt, Word export) in the desktop app now opens a native Save
  dialog, with **Показать** to find the file. Downloads were switched off in the app window.

## 2.5.0 (2026-09-28): Built-in local model

- **A local AI model with one click, with nothing else to install.** Settings → AI → **Built-in**:
  press **Download** and the app fetches the model and its engine itself, with progress. It
  resumes if the connection drops and checks both files by checksum. From then on,
  summaries and requirement extraction can run on your computer, offline, and nothing
  leaves it.
- The app picks the model that fits your computer: **Gemma 4 12B** (6.5 GB, 16 GB of memory
  or more) or **Qwen3.5 4B** (2.6 GB, from 8 GB of memory).
- The model starts by itself when needed, runs on the Apple GPU or on any Windows GPU (with
  a CPU fallback), and stops after 15 minutes of idleness and when you quit, freeing the
  memory. It listens only on this computer, behind a private key.
- **"Local only" projects** now use the built-in model, with nothing to set up. If it isn't
  downloaded yet, the app tells you where to get it and never falls back to the cloud.
- Ollama stays available as a third option for those who already use it.
- **GPU-aware choice.** What decides speed is GPU memory, not just RAM. The app reads the
  graphics card and its memory (on a Mac, the shared memory), recommends the model that
  runs at full speed on it, and says plainly when a model would be slower or when there's no
  suitable GPU.
- If the app is force-quit or crashes, a model server left running is stopped on the next
  launch. It only ever stops its own server, identified by the exact port.
- Turning on **"Local only"** for a project when the model isn't downloaded yet offers the
  download right there.
- The rail shows the app version. A long summary scrolls on its own. Recording has a big
  record button, and the record and upload cards line up.

## 2.4.0 (2026-09-25): Increment 2, requirement atoms

- **Extract requirements from any source.** On a transcript, email or document, click
  **Extract requirements**: the AI reads it in parts (with progress) and returns small,
  testable **atoms**: functional, non-functional, or open questions.
- **Every atom has proof.** Each one carries an exact quote with time and speaker. Quotes
  are checked against the real text, and atoms whose quote can't be found are dropped.
  Click a quote to open the source at that line.
- **New Atoms screen** (step 3 in the rail): "N to review · A of T accepted", filters by
  status and type, accept / edit / reject with the keyboard (`j` `k` `a` `x` `e`) and
  Undo. Edited atoms keep their original wording.
- **Duplicates and conflicts across sources.** New atoms are compared with the project's
  existing ones. Duplicates are merged, and their quotes move to the existing atom.
  Contradictions are shown as conflicts: keep A, keep B, merge into one statement, or turn
  the conflict into a question for the client (answering it closes the conflict).
- Extracting again replaces only the atoms you haven't reviewed yet. Accepted and rejected
  ones stay.
- "Local only" projects extract with the local model. Every decision goes into the audit log.
- Libraries from 2.3.0 are upgraded automatically.
- **UI fixes:** a long summary next to the transcript now scrolls on its own, with its
  header pinned. Recording has a big record button with the microphone menu right under it,
  and the record and upload cards line up. The rail shows the app version instead of
  "local".

## 2.3.0 (2026-09-23): Increment 1 complete

- **Recordings use their separate channels.** Your microphone is transcribed as **You (BA)**,
  and the call audio as the other side (with speaker separation if it's on). Both are merged in
  time order, so you never need speaker separation to tell yourself apart. Short clips get
  accurate start times too.
- **Emails as sources:** `.eml` and Outlook `.msg` (read without Outlook). Subject becomes the
  title, and sender, recipients and date are shown; the body is shown as paragraphs.
- **Documents as sources:** earlier specifications, notes (`.docx`, `.pdf`, `.txt`, `.md`)
  without speakers or timestamps are kept as documents and shown as paragraphs, not as a
  fake transcript.
- Summaries know whether they're summarising a call, an email or a document.
- Speakers show as "You (BA)", "Other side", "Speaker 1, 2…" until you rename them.
- Libraries created by 2.2.0 are upgraded automatically.
- Fixed: an email to several recipients lost its "To" field.

## 2.2.0 (2026-09-23): Increment 1, source library (part 1)

- **Everything is saved.** Recordings, uploaded audio, imported transcripts and summaries
  are kept in a local library per project, with their files. Close the app and it's all
  still there. Deleting is recoverable (Undo).
- **Projects.** Create and switch projects from the top of the left rail, rename or
  archive them in Settings. **Local only** per project: its summaries always use the local
  model, never the cloud.
- **New multi-screen interface** (the prototype's layout, Russian by default, English in
  Settings):
  - **Sources**: record or upload, live progress, the list of everything saved, with
    status, duration and speakers; rename and delete in place.
  - **Transcript**: audio player; click a timestamp to jump there, and the playing line is
    highlighted. Rename speakers once and the name appears everywhere, including the
    summary. Summary alongside, copy, download .txt, transcribe again.
  - **Settings**: a full screen for the project, AI summaries, speaker separation,
    language and environment status.
  - Steps 3–6 (Atoms, Document, Decomposition, Export) are shown as "later".
  - The previous single page is still at `/classic` while the new one settles.
- Recordings are named in the interface language; Russian plurals are correct everywhere.
- Fixed: project names differing only in Cyrillic letter case counted as different.

## 2.1.0 (2026-09-23)

- **Redesigned interface.**
  - Three collapsible sections: **Source** (upload or record), **Transcription options**
    (shared by both, collapsed to a one-line summary) and **Result** (summary, transcript,
    segments, word timestamps, each collapsible). The app remembers what you collapsed.
  - One spacing scale and one type scale across the page, Settings and the Setup screen.
    One set of components: section, panel, field, button, status.
  - Scales from phones (360 px) to wide screens: panels sit side by side when there's
    room and stack when there isn't; tables scroll instead of breaking the layout;
    Settings becomes a full-screen sheet on small windows.
  - Light and dark themes follow the system and use the prototype's palette.
    System fonts only, so nothing is fetched from the internet.
- **Fixed: recording on the Mac captured nothing ("No audio captured").**
  - The Mac app now runs Python inside its own process, so macOS asks for microphone
    and system-audio access *for Requirements Workbench*. Before, the app handed over to
    a separate Python program, which macOS silently refused without ever asking.
  - The app asks for the microphone before recording and, if access is off, says where
    to turn it on (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone).
  - System audio no longer stalls when nothing is playing: silences are filled, so both
    channels stay in sync and Stop always works. A channel that delivers nothing, or
    system audio that stayed silent throughout, is reported with the likely reason.
- **Fixed:** the microphone list could be empty, and it offered "System audio" as a
  microphone (system audio is always recorded on its own).

- **AI summaries.** A **Summarize** button under every transcript (recorded, uploaded
  or imported) writes a summary in the transcript's language: overview, key points,
  requirements mentioned, decisions, open questions and action items. Each point
  cites the speaker and timestamp it came from. The text streams in live.
  - **Claude** (default: Claude Opus 5; Sonnet 5 or Haiku 4.5 selectable): add your
    Anthropic API key in **Settings → AI summaries**. Only the transcript text is sent,
    never audio.
  - **Local model via Ollama** (e.g. `qwen3:8b`): nothing leaves your computer.
  - Clear messages for a wrong key, rate limits, overload, no internet, or Ollama not running.
- Attaching a transcript file now says **Summarize**, and summarises right away.
- The **Summarize** button and the summary sit at the top of the results (the summary
  used to appear below a long transcript, out of sight). The page scrolls to the summary,
  shows elapsed time while waiting, and long transcripts scroll in their own box.
- If Summarize needs a key, entering it in Settings continues the summary automatically.
- Summary headings are written in the transcript's language too.
- **Fixed:** PDFs and transcript files were greyed out in the macOS desktop file picker.
- **Fixed:** keys and tokens from Settings are now stored in your user folder
  (private to you), not inside the app, where saving could break the macOS app or be
  lost on update. Existing tokens keep working.
- **Fixed:** pressing Save with an empty Hugging Face token field no longer deletes the saved token.
- **Import a transcript you already have.** Drop it where you drop audio: no speech
  recognition, it opens instantly with speakers and timestamps kept. Supported:
  - Microsoft Teams: `.vtt` or `.docx` transcript export (speaker names kept)
  - PDF with a text layer: Teams/Otter PDF exports or any document; page headers
    like "Page 2 of 5" are dropped. Scanned PDFs get a clear message (no OCR yet)
  - Zoom / Google Meet: `.vtt`
  - Subtitles: `.srt`
  - Plain text: `Name: text` lines, timestamped lines, or text copied from this app
  - This app's own `.json` result
  - Russian text in any common encoding (UTF-8, UTF-16, Windows-1251)
- Transcript tables show times as `mm:ss`, and file content is always shown as text,
  never interpreted as HTML (important for files from outside).
- Results appear without the 1.5 s polling delay.

## 1.1.1 (2026-09-23), published in release v2.0

- **Fixed: "Access to 127.0.0.1 was denied / HTTP ERROR 403" on startup.** The app used
  port 5000, which the macOS AirPlay Receiver (and sometimes other software) already
  uses. The app mistook it for an already-running copy of itself and showed that
  server's error page. It now uses its own port (47823), falls back to any free port
  when that's taken, and recognises a running copy only when it identifies itself.
- **Fixed: in browser mode the app quit right after first-run setup** instead of
  opening the app.
- Closing or killing the app always cleans up its instance record.

## 1.1.0 — Increment 0: stable base (2026-09-23), published in release v2.0

First step from GigaAM Transcriber towards Requirements Workbench
(`docs/specs/requirements-workbench-spec.md`, §12.2 increment 0). No new
end-user features yet: this makes the existing transcriber safe, installable
without prerequisites, and a native app on both Windows and macOS.

### Renamed: GigaAM Transcriber → Requirements Workbench
The app, installers and macOS bundle now carry the product's name. The Windows
installer upgrades an existing GigaAM Transcriber 1.0 in place and removes its
old shortcuts. GigaAM remains the speech-recognition engine.

### Install & platform
- **No prerequisites.** Installers bundle Python 3.12; the app's **Setup screen**
  installs PyTorch (CUDA / Apple GPU / CPU, picked for the machine), GigaAM (pinned),
  ffmpeg and the speech model on first launch, with progress, automatic retries and
  resume. Every later start re-checks in ~0.01 s and repairs anything missing.
- **macOS app** (`.dmg`, Apple Silicon, macOS 13+) with a native launcher, so the
  Dock and permission prompts show the app's name.
- **Windows installer**: per-user, no admin rights, installs WebView2 if missing,
  asks before deleting your data on uninstall.
- Desktop window by default on both OSes; `--browser` / "Browser Mode" shortcut optional.
  Falls back to the browser if the window can't open.
- Downloaded components, models and recordings live in
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\RequirementsWorkbench` / `~/Library/Application Support/RequirementsWorkbench`.

### Recording
- **macOS desktop app records call audio** (macOS 14.2+, Core Audio process taps):
  no browser, screen sharing or virtual audio driver needed.
- Mic and system audio are recorded as **separate channels**, streamed to disk while
  recording (constant memory; a crash no longer loses the call).
- Problems with a channel (device missing, permission denied) are shown live and after
  recording instead of being silently dropped.

### Reliability & security
- The local server accepts only local connections in every mode (browser mode used to
  be reachable from the whole LAN, including the settings endpoint).
- Transcriptions are queued and run one at a time, showing the queue position.
- Fixed: temp upload leaked after ffmpeg conversion; desktop recordings downloaded
  as `.webm` although they were WAV; recording start ignored server errors.

### Test checklist for this increment
Windows 10/11 PC (ideally with an NVIDIA GPU) and a Mac (Apple Silicon, macOS 14.2+):
1. Install from the installer / `.dmg` on a machine **without Python** → app opens.
   *Mac: first open via right-click → Open (not notarized yet).*
2. Setup screen runs by itself and opens the app (few minutes, first run only).
   On NVIDIA check the console summary / GPU button shows the GPU.
3. Settings → paste a Hugging Face token (see README) → speaker separation works.
4. Upload an audio file → transcript (with and without speaker separation, a file > 1 min).
5. Record a short Teams/Zoom/YouTube call in the **desktop window**: both your voice and
   the other side are in the recording. Allow the microphone / system audio prompts.
6. Unplug the mic mid-recording (or deny a permission) → the app says which channel failed
   and still saves the other one.
7. Close and reopen the app → starts straight into the app (no setup), in a few seconds.
8. From another device on your network, open `http://<your-PC-IP>:47823` → must not connect.
